When I tried to run valgrind --leak-check=yes -g ./finalcode.cc I got permission denied. 

Cppcheck did not output any errors all it said was checking finalcode.cc.

I didn't have time to run google test.

My code does not work correctly.

curl did leak some memory but not permanently.
wc did not leak memory.
